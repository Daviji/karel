h1. Karel (now in Python)

Karel is a pretty snazzy environment for learning to program. You can "read about it here":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karel_(programming_language). I decided to write a Karel environment for Python, after seeing that all of the others had too many dependencies for beginners.
